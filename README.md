# todo

Is there too much on your mind? Does it seem like a permanent state? Me too, but maybe it doesn't have to be that way.

Traditional to-do lists expect too much of you right now, with no room for ideas that need some time and space.

Workflow and project management tools keep track of ideas over time, but don't do much to help organize those ideas for you. It's all manual, and it often stops at a multi-week granularity where ordering and to-dos often remain unclear.

Within my limited awareness, none of these follows an open source tools-first ethos. 

Hopefully we can change that.

Ideas
-----

* Use Github as the source of truth for any given project's todos.
* Build a general tool for updating todo repositories.
* Build out some interesting workflows that I want for managing my affairs.
* Hope the community joins in!
